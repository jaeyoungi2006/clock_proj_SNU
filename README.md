# Clock project SNU
Mechanical Clock with Stepper Motors
This project is for a mechanical clock using 4 stepper motors â€” two for hours and two for minutes. The system utilizes a custom stepper motor driver (step_motor.h) to control the motors and wifi_time.h to fetch accurate time from an NTP server via Wi-Fi. The clock hands move accordingly to display the correct time. The setup works with microcontrollers like ESP32 or ESP8266. The system ensures accurate timekeeping by synchronizing with the NTP server.
